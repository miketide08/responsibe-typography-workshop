# Responsive Web Typography (2018)

This project was created using the course Responsive Web Typography v2 (link below in Acknowledgements section), which I used to discover
many features of responsive typography and the great impact typography can have on a given web site. This workshop used examples to show
how these techniques can be added to your web projects now and some of the technology is cutting edge, like variable fonts (as of 2018).
In addition, several resources were provided to aid and ispire when choosing the right typography for a website. 

Some of the topics learned: 
  *Variable fonts - New generation of web fonts that are very small in file size and allow for massive customization and scaling. 
  Variable fonts are the fonts of the future and can be used with the latest version of all major web browsers (as of August 2018). 
  Go ahead and start using them today.
  *Dynamic calculation of CSS typography settings across all media queries using CSS variables and calculations in the CSS.
  *Fallback method to ensure a web page loads all text and doesn't block rendering a site until the web fonts 
  finish loading. This technique works even if JavaScript is disabled. 
  *CSS @supports - feature used to handle loading the correct fonts based upon browser support.
  *Deep dive into the Four Tenants of Responsive Typography: Performance, Progression, Proportion and Polish.
  *Guidance to find inspiration when selecting the right font(s) to use for a web site. Mnay factors go into choosing the best typography
  for a given site.
  *Text first design

around with the sizing of the page manually or by using your dev web tools to check out the responsiveness of the typography on each example web site.

### Prerequisites

Local web browser installed like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge. As of writing this in August of 2018, recent versions of most browsers will be needed to display 
variable fonts.
